# My Portfolio

## Introduction

*My Portfolio* is a website which aims to showcase my work and overall skills to let others know more about myself.

Ideally, I want the website to include a homepage with my skills and projects displayed as well as links to my LinkedIn and Github. It will basically be a landing page, although I will likely add some pages (for little projects that do not need to have a dedicated website for exemple).

The design will be simple but I will make it user friendly, appealing and interactive so I can showcase the most of my frontend skills. To demonstrate my proficiency on the backend side, I plan on using APIs for small projects that will be displayed on the website.

### Languages
- **JavaScript**: add interactivity, flexible, work in frontend and backend
- **Typescript**: better code completion and error detection
- **CSS**: a little bit of custom styles

### Package manager
- **npm (v9.4.0)**: to manage dependencies, huge library 

### Frameworks
- **React**: fast, clear, huge doc and community
- **Next.js (v15.3.0)**: built-in features for routing, APIs, SSR...
- **Tailwind**: easy responsive, create customs designs quickly

### Linter
- **ESLint**: already bundled in the base configuration, flexible, works with JS, JSX and TypeScript
